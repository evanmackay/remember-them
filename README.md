## Description
With 3 of our team members having served in the United States armed forces, we wanted to construct
a site that would serve as a memorial for all of those men and women who came before us who made the 
ultimate sacrifice for their country. The main page of the site contains a brief snippet about
each fallen service member along with their photo. We have also included a page for the creeds
of each branch and another with links to other various resources related to the military.

## Contributing
Anyone is welcome to make a submission for someone they know who served and has passed away.
All new submissions must be reviewed by administrators before they appear on the site so 
expect a small wait time for the request to be processed. If you wish to contribute to
our code, feel free to contact us directly through the website and we can collaborate on
making new additions or changes to the site.

## Future Development
In the future our team plans to correct the issues the site currently has with responsive design for easier use on any device. Additionally, 
since the data scraped from the navy seal foundation site was not complete enough to fill out all of the data we include for each service member
we would like to complete their records for a better user experience. One final adjustment is to make admin access for approving or denying
new requests more secure through means of a login portal and inclusion of the passport module.

## Credits
Special thanks to the Navy SEAL foundation, we utilized data pulled from their site to
begin building our database of fallen service members. Visit them at https://www.navysealfoundation.org.
