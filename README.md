## Description
With 3 of our team members having served in the United States armed forces, we wanted to construct
a site that would serve as a memorial for all of those who came before us and who made the 
ultimate sacrifice for their country. The main page of the site contains a brief snippet about
each fallen service member along with their photo. We have also included a page for the creeds
of each branch and another with links to other various resources related to the military.

## Contributing
Anyone is welcome to make a submission for someone they know who served and has passed away.
All new submissions must be reviewed by administrators before they appear on the site so 
expect a small wait time for the request to be processed. If you wish to contribute to
our code, feel free to contact us directly through the website and we can collaborate on
making new additions or changes to the site.

Special thanks to the Navy SEAL foundation, we utilized data pulled from their site to
begin building our database of fallen service members. Visit them at https://www.navysealfoundation.org.
